Meet ECHO, your new digital assitant. Continue reading to learn how to set it up, or click [HERE](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/887050449/) for the interactive instructions.

1. Create a new python file
2. Open the terminal and paste each of the followining into it one at a time
     pip install pyttsx3
     pip install speechrecognition
     pip install openai
     pip install pyaudio
     pip install colorama

3. Copy the raw file contents of the main file in this repository and paste it into your python file
4. If you don't already have an OpenAI account, create one [HERE](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
5. Go [HERE](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) to get an OpenAI API Key
6. Copy your key. Go to line 51 of the main file and replace <YOUR-OPENAI-KEY-HERE> with your new key
7. Go to line 191. Delete the part that says <"PUT EVERYTHING YOU WANT ECHO TO LEARN AND KNOW HERE> and replace it with everything ECHO needs to know when he runs. Make sure to put it inside the quotation marks or the program won't work.
8. Compile the program. When the program says "Ready", summon ECHO by saying his name. Once he indicates that he is listening, say whatever you want. Make sure that it isn't too loud, and make sure that you wait because the program can take a while.
